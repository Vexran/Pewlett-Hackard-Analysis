# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
### Resources:
Using SQL- relational databases

This analysis aims to develop Pewlett-Hackard, a company with many employees, for the "silver tsunami." Many employees will begin their retirement rapidly in the next few years, so the company wants to be prepared with job openings, retirement packages, and employee training.  The analysis focuses on a few examples to ensure a smooth transition.
1. Identify the retiring employees by their titles.
2. Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
3. Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship 
4. program.
5. Determine the number of roles to fill grouped by title and department. Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation grouped by tag and department.
### Results
With the retirment_titles table we are able to see every eligible for retirement employee and how long they have - worked at each position over the course of their career.

The final part of our project shows mentorship eligibility; if you look at the head of the new CSV - you can see that most of these employees have a senior title.

### Summary
63 % of the workforce is either retirement or mentorship eligible. Many positions will likely be filled over the next 5-10 years. There may not be enough workforce to take care of the tasks or even come close to the amount of experience to fill these roles so quickly. Companies can try to best learn about what these employees did to successfully have such long-lasting careers to continue the tradition for future employees. Most likely, the future generation is more computer savvy/ efficient due to technologies and can catch on quickly, helping companies continue to trend in the right direction by keeping revenues up.
